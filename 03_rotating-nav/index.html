        <h1>First Moon Walk by Amazing Astronaut</h1>
        <small>Neil Armstrong</small>

          The flight plan called for a crew rest period before leaving the
          module, but Armstrong asked for this to be moved to earlier in the
          evening, Houston time. When he and Aldrin were ready to go outside,
          Eagle was depressurized, the hatch was opened, and Armstrong made his
          way down the ladder. At the bottom of the ladder, while standing on a
          Lunar Module landing pad, Armstrong said, "I'm going to step off the
          LM now". He turned and set his left boot on the lunar surface at 02:56
          UTC July 21, 1969, then said, "That's one small step for [a] man, one
          giant leap for mankind." The exact time of Armstrong's first step on
          the Moon is unclear. Armstrong prepared his famous epigram on his own.
          In a post-flight press conference, he said that he chose the words
          "just prior to leaving the LM." In a 1983 interview in Esquire
          magazine, he explained to George Plimpton: "I always knew there was a
          good chance of being able to return to Earth, but I thought the
          chances of a successful touch down on the moon surface were about even
          money—fifty–fifty ... Most people don't realize how difficult the
          mission was. So it didn't seem to me there was much point in thinking
          of something to say if we'd have to abort landing." In 2012, his
          brother Dean Armstrong said that Neil showed him a draft of the line
          months before the launch Historian Andrew Chaikin, who interviewed
          Armstrong in 1988 for his book A Man on the Moon, disputed that
          Armstrong claimed to have conceived the line during the mission.

          Recordings of Armstrong's transmission does not provide evidence for
          the indefinite article "a" before "man", though NASA and Armstrong
          insisted for years that static obscured it. Armstrong stated he would
          never make such a mistake, but after repeated listenings to
          recordings, he eventually conceded he must have dropped the "a". He
          later said he "would hope that history would grant me leeway for
          dropping the syllable and understand that it was certainly intended,
          even if it was not said—although it might actually have been". There
          have since been claims and counter-claims about whether acoustic
          analysis of the recording reveals the presence of the missing "a";
          Peter Shann Ford, an Australian computer programmer, conducted a
          digital audio analysis and claims that Armstrong did say "a man", but
          the "a" was inaudible due to the limitations of communications
          technology of the time. Ford and James R. Hansen, Armstrong's
          authorized biographer, presented these findings to Armstrong and NASA
          representatives, who conducted their own analysis. Armstrong found
          Ford's analysis "persuasive." Linguists David Beaver and Mark Liberman
          wrote of their skepticism of Ford's claims on the blog Language Log. A
          2016 peer-reviewed study again concluded Armstrong had included the
          article. NASA's transcript continues to show the "a" in parentheses.
          When Armstrong made his proclamation, Voice of America was rebroadcast
          live by the BBC and many other stations worldwide. An estimated 530
          million people viewed the event, 20 percent out of a world population
          of approximately 3.6 billion.
